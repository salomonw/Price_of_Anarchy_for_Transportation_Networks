# Price_of_Anarchy_for_Transportation_Networks
This repository contains the scripts for estimating the Price of Anarchy on Transportation Networks by using real-data. Specifically, we are working with INRIX traffic data for the Eastern Massachussets road network. This research is based on Dr. Zhang work available at [InverseVIsTraffic](https://github.com/jingzbu/InverseVIsTraffic).
For a deepear understanding, please read the related publications.
